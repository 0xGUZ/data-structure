# Data Structures

I will code all data structures and create a complete C library on data structures with helper functions, sorting algorithms and more.

### headers/ds.c

This is the main package/header, you can find all the algorithms inside of it.

Current algorithms:

Selection Sort - Time O(nÂ²)

Merge Sort - Time O(n*log(n))

### Compiling

Just copy the compiling line at the end of the file, it will compile and run the code.

gcc renameThis-sort.c headers/ds.c -ansi -pedantic -Wall -o renameThis-sort && ./renameThis-sort
